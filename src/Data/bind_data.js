Then aim your crosshair on the left side of the crate about half way up. If they continue to hold hookah, you can slow push and be ready to wall bang the couch. It's relatively safe since you're darting from the left hand side of B short. Careful red spot, it's an off angle and that's the only spot that won't be scanned. I've yet to see someone hold from there, but be careful."

Then shoot right under the black metal box on the wall above it. It doesn't reveal the market side of A short, so be careful of that. It can scan the area, but they can easily lose line of sight. "

			"I think this is one of the best darts for defending A side. A lot of teams push up from market side of short, and not stair side, and this catches many teams off guard. Align yourself so where the box is flush with the corner of the wall in the 1st image (same as stair side dart). Then shoot right above the black spec on the wall on the 2nd picture. Very good dart that reveals the slow pushers. Mix this dart up with the stair side dart so it doesn't always get shot. You can aim higher on the wall, and the dart will end up on the doorway instead of the ground. There's a wire on the wall, make sure you don't hit the wire on the first bounce. "

This dart will land in the back, while giving you enough time to position yourself. It also forces people to to turn around and shoot it, giving you a chance to peek. Align the 4th brick so that it touches the right tip of the health bar lines. Make sure it's in the middle of the 4th bar as shown in yellow in the picture. If someone slow pushes, or holds the B long angle and stays back in the yellow spot, it scans the area, but they can easily loose line of sight behind the box. "

Aim where the red drapes meet the ceiling. Make sure you delay this shot, because most people chill in market for the first several seconds of a round. The only downside is that it doesn't reach into market. Thanks to redditor u/KhigenNA for finding this dart!"

If it's shot, you know it has to be from lamps. Align your hud with the yellow spot on the bottom so that the tip touches the yellow paint on the metal box. There it a small, lighter spec of yellow on the tip of the yellow paint, make it so that the tip of your hud is fully covering the lighter spec of yellow. Careful for the red spot, if they hold a wide angle, it won't scan them. But if they hold a wide angle to expose themself from both sides, swing on them. Combine this dart with a phoenix or viper wall to easily get lamps control. "

It can potentially scan someone inside the big box, but don't count on it because they can easily lose line of sight. Darts that land in the back, instead of the corner, function the same, but cannot potentially expose someone holding inside big box like this one can. Align your crosshair so that it's right above the tip of the sign. Anyone that holds back cubby will be exposed, but I wouldn't worry about it because back cubby is exposed by you sitting long. "
