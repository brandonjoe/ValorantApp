Line up your crosshair with the bottom of the red text on the side of the metal container on B site. If you run, you should have enough time to peek with an awp. The great part about this dart is that if someone peeks up the courtyard, it will also spot them."

Unfortunately, this dart travels faster, and you won't have enough time to peek like the other dart. Use this dart if you're holding garage and your B guy needs help holding B site."

You can try to align yourself with the yellow spots on the image below, but it's still very difficul for me. It lands in the best spot on B, with almost not detection until it's too late. I won't even bother explaining how to do this one because I can't even consistently replicate it. But this dart with 2 brim smokes on either side of the metal container is a free entrance to B.

Careful for the tiny red on the map, but this arrow lands so fast, it should get a pulse off before they move. '
