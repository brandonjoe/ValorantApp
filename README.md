# SovaLineups (Valorant website)



This site is made as a personal project, as well as help others learn important lineups in RiotGame's fps shooter, Valorant. It's a site build with React, and uses Context API for state management. Here you'll find update to date lineups across all the current maps. 



### Demo

### General Use



Simply pick a map from the bottom, or navagation bar on the top. Pick a line up from the list on the left. Because of React Router, refreshing the page outside of the homescreen won't work. 



### Future plans



Many future plans, the first one would be use Router to allow refreshing of direct URLs, and have QOL improvements. I also want to work on refactoring some code and cleaning it up a bit. Then add more stuff related to content. Whether it be more maps, or adding shock darts and ultimate wall bangs.



### Takeaway



This project was super fun for me, not only because I'm already passionate about the game, but because I learned much from this. Both from a design perspective, as well as learning a lot on how Riot makes their websites. Many hours were spent under the hood of Riot's own [website](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/), and I was always amazed on how efficient and clean their structure was. 

### Inspiration

The majority of the inspiration came from [playValorant.com](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/), as well as [Dmitry Kiiashco](https://dribbble.com/UnEpicKid). I took a few media assets from him to help with the design. A lot of inspiration for the content/darts inside the site came from u/KhigenNA, big thanks to them.
